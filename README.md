- `user(id: ID!)`: Fetch a specific user by ID.
- `getCurrentUser`: Fetch the currently authenticated user.
- `products`: Fetch all products.

bash

CopyEdit

`Authorization: Bearer <Your-Token-Here>`

- **BUYER**: Can create orders and buy products but **cannot** create products
- **ADMIN**: Can manage users, orders, products, and more.
